				<p>I am tired of using Lorem Ipsum text.  I am also tired of writing a single sentence or two and repeating it over and over again.  If the page is sized in the wrong way, the repetition becomes too obvious and is distracting.  To solve this problem I'm writing this paragraph.  I'm now wondering if it is long enough.  I will check now.  Well, the paragraph isn't long enough yet, so I'm back.  There are a lot of words I could put into this paragraph, but I'm really using a very small subset of them.</p>
